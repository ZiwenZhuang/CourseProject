College Scorecard May 30, 2013 Too often, students and their families don’t
have the right tools to help them sort through the information they need to
decide which college or university is right for them. The search can be
overwhelming, and the information from different colleges can be hard to
compare. That’s why, today, our Administration released a “College Scorecard”
that empowers families to make smart investments in higher education. As the
President said last night, we want to help families get the most bang for
their educational buck. The College Scorecard – as part of President Obama’s
continued efforts to hold colleges accountable for cost, value and quality –
highlights key indicators about the cost and value of institutions across the
country to help students choose a school that is well-suited to meet their
needs, priced affordably, and is consistent with their educational and career
goals. The tool is interactive, so students can choose among any number of
options based on their individual needs – including location, size, campus
setting, and degree and major programs. Each Scorecard includes five key
pieces of data about a college: costs, graduation rate, loan default rate,
average amount borrowed, and employment. These data will be updated
periodically, and the Department plans to publish information on average
earnings in the coming year. Get started by visiting whitehouse.gov/scorecard.
